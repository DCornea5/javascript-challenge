WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

Write a code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [provided dataset]((UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js).  

Allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. 

The repository for this project is called `javascript-challenge`. 

Inside ythe repository, there are two directories for the Javascript folders **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**.

Each level contains specific **html** files as well as static folder containing javascript. 


### UFO-Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Create a basic HTML web page [index.html](UFO-level-1/index.html) 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* The HTML table has teh following columns `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` 

* Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

* Create a HTML web page [index.html](UFO-level-2/index.html) 

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
